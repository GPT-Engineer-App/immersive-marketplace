# immersive-marketplace

Design an interactive, multi-vendor e-commerce platform inspired by the immersive experience of drakerelated.com, but enhanced with a 3D virtual tour functionality for both VR and non-VR users. This marketplace will cater to local businesses across various categories like clothing, fragrances, and furniture. Each store within the platform can be customized using templates that reflect the businessâ€™s physical storefront, enabling virtual navigation similar to Google Maps street view. Include AI support for product photo optimization and descriptions, streamlined payment tracking, and integrated shipping solutions. The interface aims to replicate the tactile sensation of shopping in-person, offering users a vivid, engaging experience of moving through each store and interacting with products.
